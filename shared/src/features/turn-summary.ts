/**
 * Per-turn AI summary of a session conversation.
 *
 * A "turn" is the message range `[user_message_id, next_user_message_id)`.
 * Once the next user message is committed, the turn is finalised and its
 * summary can be cached permanently. A summary's `asOfMessageId` records the
 * last message that was in the turn at generation time — clients compare it
 * to the current last-message-in-turn to detect staleness.

/**
 * Lifecycle types for the terminal subsystem refactor.
 *
 * This file is the contract shared between the future TerminalController, the React views,
 * and the message-handler / store layers. It introduces no runtime behavior on its own —
 * the existing code paths continue to work unchanged until subsequent refactor phases wire
 * these types in.
 *
 * Naming convention follows the discriminated-union style used elsewhere in the codebase
 * (`ContentBlock`, `InteractionMessage`, etc.) so destructuring and exhaustive switches
 * keep readability consistent.

/**
 * Why a terminal handed off ownership of its PTY to "no one" (server-side `clientId = null`).
 *
 * - `popout`            — user dragged the panel into a standalone Tauri window. The main-window
 *                         instance should self-dispose; the new window claims ownership.
 * - `backend_offline`   — the backend facade emitted offline / error. The PTY may or may not still
 *                         exist on the server; reattach when the backend comes back.
 * - `ws_reconnect`      — the WebSocket transport bounced (no offline event, just a fresh `client.id`).
 *                         A reattach is needed to refresh ownership; the user should ideally
 *                         not notice anything.

/**
 * Discriminated union covering every observable state of a single terminal in the client.
 *
 * Designed so that:
 *   • `kind` alone is enough for UI to choose what to render (loading, terminal, error banner, …)
 *   • Payload data only lives on states that need it (e.g. exit code on `exited`)
 *   • Adding a new state forces every `switch` to handle it (TS exhaustiveness)
 *
 * Transitions are documented in {@link TERMINAL_LIFECYCLE_TRANSITIONS} below.
